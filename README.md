# club-management-CSEC
This is my entrance project for the club management site for CSEC club
This is a clun membership management web app developped by Fenan Yosef single handedly.
This project is made by using html/css/bootsrap/Javascript for front end, Javascript/NodeJs for Backend and MySQL for Database
Things I want to mention are that, there aren't free sites to host MySQL for free so I will let the person Who wants to test to download the Zip file
After downloading it to you file, create a new database called in your local database(Mysql), "CREATE DATABASE newnode"
After that go to the data directory and run the two scripts I have included in There, That will create the needed Initial table for the database

after that start the backend and run localhost://3600 in your browser
that will bring you the login page
For admin: username - Admin
           password - 1234
For User: username - User
          password - 1234
The app includes:
● Members Database: Add, edit, remove, and list functionalities.
● Event Management: Tools to manage club events. such ass add events and delete 
  events on the admin web, and view in user page
● Reporting Dashboard: Generate reports on membership statistics. I included weekly 
  statistics in the dashboard which will update on a weekly basis by recording activities
● User Authentication: Secure login system for different user roles. and Also encryption and decryption 
  upon saving the user data into database. adding extra layer of security into it
● Members Area: Personalized area for members to view and manage their
  information. and also change Their passwords
● Role-Based Access Control: Different access levels for administrators and
  members.
● Additional Feature (Optional): A very friendly UI/UX, Assigning ID to users upon registration, 
  Adding photos when posting new events, security, requires authentication for every activity making it very secure.

The app is to big to be explaind by few words here, please take a tour yourself and see what it does,
